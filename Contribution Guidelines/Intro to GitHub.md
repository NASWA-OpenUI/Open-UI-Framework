# GitHub Terms and Usage Guide

## Branch
Create your own workspace to make changes without affecting what others see. This lets you draft and experiment safely.

> **Example:** "I want to update a process document → I'll create a separate **branch** to work on my changes"

## Comment
Provide feedback, ask questions, or suggest edits on specific parts of documents.

> **Example:** "I have a suggestion about this paragraph → I'll add a **comment** to that specific section"

## Clone
Download a copy of the repository to your computer to work on files locally.

> **Example:** "I need to make several document updates → I'll **clone** the repository to my computer"

## Commit
Save your changes with a brief description of what you modified and why.

> **Example:** "I've finished updating the contact list → I'll **commit** these changes with a note explaining what I updated"

## Draft Pull Request
Work on changes and get early feedback before they're ready for final review.

> **Example:** "I've started updating the process guide but want early input → I'll create a **draft** PR to share my progress"

## Fork
Create your own copy of the repository that you can freely modify.

> **Example:** "I want to propose changes to our documentation → I'll **fork** the repo to work on my ideas"

## Issues
Start or join discussions about specific topics, track tasks, or suggest improvements.

> **Example:** "I noticed our FAQ needs updating → I'll open an **issue** to discuss this with the team"

## Labels
Add categories or status indicators to issues and pull requests to keep things organized.

> **Example:** "This document needs legal review → I'll add the 'legal-review' **label** so the right team sees it"

## Markdown (.md files)
Format text documents with headers, lists, and other styling using simple symbols.

> **Example:** "I need to make this text bold → I'll add \*\* before and after the text in a **markdown** file"

## Merge
Combine approved changes from a pull request into the main document.

> **Example:** "The team has approved my updates → they will **merge** my changes into the main branch"

## Milestone
Group related issues or pull requests together to track progress toward a goal or deadline.

> **Example:** "These updates are for our Q2 release → I'll add them to the Q2 Documentation **milestone**"

## Projects
View and organize work across multiple documents or tasks in a board-style layout.

> **Example:** "I want to see all documentation tasks in one place → I'll check our team's **Project** board."

## Pull Request (PR)
Share your proposed changes with the team and gather feedback before making them official.

> **Example:** "I've finished my document updates → I'll create a **pull request** so my changes can be reviewed"

## README
Find essential information about the repository and how to use it.

> **Example:** "I'm new to this project → I'll check the README for guidance on getting started."

## Repository (Repo)
This is where you'll go to find, view, and work with all your team's documents and files. It is the team's shared workspace.

> **Example:** "I need to find the latest version of our style guide → I'll check our team's **repository**"

## Sync/Pull
