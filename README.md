**Open UI Framework Documentation Repository**
This repository serves as our central document management system. The repository is organized into three main directories to help maintain clear separation between reference materials, work in progress, and published documents.

**Directory Structure**
- **Overview/:** Contains reference documents explaining repository usage and guidelines
- **Published/:** Houses approved, final versions of documents
- **Working/:** Contains in-progress documents and drafts

Please refer to the README in each directory for specific usage guidelines.
