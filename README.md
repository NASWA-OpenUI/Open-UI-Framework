# README

The purose of this repository is to host the Open UI Framework, define the modules within it, and how a standardized data schema supports those modules. We will evolve the Framework over time with community support whether that is changing module boundaries, adapting interactions between modules, or optimizing a moduleâ€™s outputs for new standards and technologies. Please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NASWA-OpenUI/Open-UI-Framework/blob/main/Contribution%20Guidelines/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
