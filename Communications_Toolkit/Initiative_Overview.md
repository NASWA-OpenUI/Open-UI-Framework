### Q2 FY25 

- Established the Open UI public repository on GitHub. In our repository, we:  
  - Published our community engagement process, including a code of conduct, contributing guide, and an FAQ 
  - Developed internal administration policies, including how to escalate and manage community issues and managing access requests 
  - Released version 1.0 of the [Open UI Module Set ](https://github.com/NASWA-OpenUI/Open-UI-Framework/blob/e04596e3757e4b517031bfb3c464b4c2be5656ed/Open%20UI%20Initiative%20Module%20Set.md)
  - Published v0.1 of the Monetary Determination module specification 
- Developed a roadmap for future module specification development 
- Posted an RFP soliciting vendor support 

### Q3 FY25 
- Identified workable and standalone UI system modules 
- Onboarded vendor teams to increase capacity and work velocity 
- Refreshed the Open UI Initiative 
- Collected user feedback on the Open UI public repository and reworked the repository information architecture based on that feedback 

### Q4 FY25 

- Began developing a taxonomy of states and their UI systems to help identify potential future pilot partners 
- Expanded our community engagement strategy, including planning for different types of inputs from different community members 
- Expanded our communications strategy, including: 
  - Began a round of audience persona research 
  - Planned sets of future communications collateral to create 
  - Established an events and meetings strategy 

### What’s upcoming? 

- Planning and vetting of potential pilot activities 
- Additional qualitative research around future adoption obstacles for the Open UI Initiative 
- Publication of additional v0.1 module specs 

 

## BACKGROUND 

### Vision 

The Open UI Initiative vision is a collaborative community promoting a resilient technology landscape and cost-effective innovation in the marketplace to support timely and accurate UI program administration. 

### Objectives 

- Define and evolve a standardized modular UI technology framework 
- Sustain a collaborative process for community contributions 
- Facilitate adoption of the Open UI Framework 

## FAQ’s 

- **What is the Open UI Initiative?** The Open UI Initiative is a collaborative effort to create a technical framework and functional definitions for state unemployment insurance systems, making them more modular and user-friendly. 

- **How does the Open UI Initiative work?** The initiative seeks to create a blueprint for UI system, allowing states and vendors to develop or modernize their systems with flexibility to fit their policies and workflows.  

- **Will the Open UI Initiative include working code?** As of March 2025, the Initiative is not seeking to create, procure, or otherwise develop working code for the modules. As the Initiative evolves this may be a part of the roadmap. To keep up to date on the latest developments in the Open UI Initiative please visit our website. 

- **Is the Open UI Initiative considered “Open Source”**? The materials created by or contributed to the Initiative are available under an Apache 2.0 license.   

- **What does the Open UI Initiative mean by the work “open”?** The Initiative recognizes that there are number of interpretations to the first word in our name, Open. We’ve come to define it in three ways: We are open in our way of working with states, vendors, and others who want to contribute to the vision of the Initiative We aim to open the UI technology marketplace to new ideas, vendors, and approaches We see value and opportunity in open-source software and communities 

 

## TERMINOLOGY 

- **Framewor**k - A framework is a structured set of guidelines, tools, or best practices that provides a foundation for developing, managing, or evaluating processes, systems, or projects. It helps organize and standardize approaches, ensuring consistency and efficiency in achieving specific goals or solving particular problems. Frameworks can apply to various fields, including software development, project management, and organizational strategy. 

- **Infrastructure** - In the context of the Open UI framework, infrastructure refers to the foundational technical environment and resources that support the development, deployment, and operation of Modules. This includes the physical and cloud-based servers, networking components, databases, development tools, and platforms that provide the necessary backbone for running and managing the modular components. A well-designed infrastructure ensures scalability, reliability, and security, enabling seamless integration and communication between modules while supporting the overall system's performance and adaptability.  

- **Interface** - In the context of the Open UI framework, an interface refers to the defined point of interaction between different modules or between a module and the rest of the system. It specifies how data is exchanged and how different modules or components communicate with each other. An interface typically includes a set of rules, protocols, and standards that ensure compatibility and seamless integration, allowing modules to interact efficiently without requiring knowledge of each other's internal workings. This enables the modular and flexible design of the system, where each module can be developed, maintained, and updated independently.  

- **Module** - A module, in the context of software or system architecture, is a self-contained unit that encapsulates one or more related functional units or a cluster of them. It serves as a cohesive building block within a larger system, providing a level of abstraction and organization that enhances manageability, reusability, and scalability. 

- **Module Set** - A Module Set is a logical grouping of related modules within a system, designed to provide a comprehensive range of functionalities by clustering components that work together. This organization enhances modularity, scalability, and manageability in complex software architectures. 

- **Module Specification** - A module specification is a document that contains descriptive text, code, diagrams, or other material that describes the functions of a module including the inputs, outputs, data standards, and known or potential connection points with other modules.
