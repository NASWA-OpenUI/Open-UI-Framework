### Introduction

The Open UI GitHub repository is a central hub for documentation and
collaboration. Your feedback plays a key role in helping us improve
these resources. This guide outlines how to submit feedback to ensure
your input is effectively captured and reviewed by the Open UI team.

The simplest path to submit feedback is by creating a GitHub **Issue**.
While items submitted might not be an actual issue or problem, it is how
GitHub consolidates user feedback related to the Open UI repo. The
following guidelines will walk you through how to create an issue, use
predefined templates for ease of creation, and further manage the ticket
and provide updates via email.

#### Markdown (.md files)
The formatting language used in GitHub to create text documents with headers, lists, and other styling using simple symbols.
