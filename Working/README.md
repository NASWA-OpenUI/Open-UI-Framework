# Working Documents Folder
This directory is for drafts and documents under development. Use this space to collaborate on documents before they're ready for publication.

**Guidelines**
- Create branches for new documents or updates
- Submit pull requests for review when ready
- Use clear, descriptive names for all files
- Link to related issues for broader discussions

**Note:** While this directory allows more flexible collaboration, all changes still require review through pull requests before merging.
**NOTE:** This is a test
